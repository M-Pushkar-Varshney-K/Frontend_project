"# INT-219_project"

exam.html file is fully made up of bootstrap. No css is used in it.

My Notes and Community pages are in the ANGULAR. But I didn'tknow how to connect the angular with the normal html like: anchor to open another file on click. But in future I do and make it more effective version of it.

THANK YOU !!!
